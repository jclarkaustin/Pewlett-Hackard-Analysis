# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Project

This project is an analysis of employees that will be meeting retirement age soon and those that may be eligible for mentorship. 

### Results
* Item 1 The company can expect a significant turnover as employees age into retirement
* Item 2 The largest retirment groups are Senior Engineers and Senior Staff
* Item 3 Only 1,940 in-house staff are available to move into the positions that will become open due to retirement.
* Item 4 Current Engineering and Staff levels are not adequate to meet future needs.

### Summary
There is a training need that will quickly escalate as employees retire from the company. There is also a lack of resources to fill open positions.
